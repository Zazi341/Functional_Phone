# Java Phone System

**Java-Phone-System** is a comprehensive Java-based phone application suite, developed as a group project for the *Software Engineering* course at Bar-Ilan University. It simulates a full-featured phone environment, including **PhoneBook**, **SMS**, **Calendar**, **Media Player**, **Phone Calls**, **Wallet**, and a **Casino**. The primary goal was to demonstrate robust object-oriented principles, design patterns, and an engaging Java Swing-based graphical user interface (GUI).

**Final Grade:** *98/100*
